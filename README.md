# Word Search Game

A fun and interactive word search game built with Python! This project features a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` and robust backend logic to provide an engaging experience. Players take turns guessing words on a dynamically loaded board, with scores and progress tracked in real-time.

## Features

## How to Play

1. **Load Word List**: Use the "Load Words List" button to upload a `.txt` file with words.
2. **Load Board**: Use the "Load Board File" button to upload a `.txt` file with the board layout.
3. **Add Players**: Add player names and start the game.
4. **Guess Words**: Players take turns entering their guesses.
